# ===========================
# ðŸ§  CONCEPT PROMPTS
# ===========================
# Prompts used during initial brainstorming phase
# to develop the core game concept for "Data Souls"

## PHASE 1: Initial Concept Exploration
---
Prompt 1: "Suggest 5 serious game concepts that explore AI ethics, data privacy, and algorithmic governance in interactive ways. Each should have a unique core mechanic."

Prompt 2: "Design a card-based decision game where players balance four competing values: Innovation, Profit, Trust, and Ethics. The game should simulate the pressure of being a policymaker in an AI-driven society."

Prompt 3: "Create a game concept inspired by 'Reigns' mechanics but focused on data governance. Players should face moral dilemmas where every choice has meaningful trade-offs."

## PHASE 2: Theme & Narrative Development
---
Prompt 4: "Develop a narrative framing where the player leads the 'Global AI Ethics Council' making decisions that affect humanity's digital future. Include stakeholder pressures from investors, regulators, the public, and visionaries."

Prompt 5: "Design an antagonist/observer character called 'The Auditor' - an AI that analyzes the player's decisions and provides philosophical commentary on their governance style."

Prompt 6: "Create 6 distinct endings for an AI governance game that reflect different philosophies: balanced governance, ethical conservatism, techno-utopianism, corporate capture, algorithmic authoritarianism, and bureaucratic mediocrity."

## PHASE 3: Core Mechanics Design
---
Prompt 7: "Design a four-metric balancing system where Innovation, Profit, Trust, and Ethics start at 50% and must be maintained. If any reaches 0, trigger instant game over with specific collapse scenarios."

Prompt 8: "Create a probability-weighted random event system where low stats increase the likelihood of crises (data leaks, protests, market crashes) and high balanced stats trigger positive breakthroughs."

Prompt 9: "Design a 12-round game structure where early rounds allow strategy setup, mid-game introduces balance mechanics to prevent runaway stats, and endgame determines legacy based on final metric distribution."

## PHASE 4: Educational Impact
---
Prompt 10: "How can a card game effectively teach players about the complexity of AI governance without being preachy? Focus on creating empathy through role-playing and consequence simulation."

Prompt 11: "Design scenarios for an AI ethics game covering: facial recognition in schools, health data trade, predictive policing, social media algorithms, autonomous vehicles, gene editing, and deepfakes."

Prompt 12: "Create a system where players experience the tension between short-term gains (approving risky tech) and long-term stability (maintaining public trust and ethical standards)."

## PHASE 5: AI Integration Planning
---
Prompt 13: "Design a generative AI commentary system that analyzes player decisions in real-time and provides thoughtful, non-judgmental reflections on their governance philosophy."

Prompt 14: "Create prompt templates for an AI character that uses metaphors related to data, networks, and algorithms to comment on player choices. The AI should be philosophical rather than instructive."

Prompt 15: "How can we use Google's Gemini API to generate context-aware feedback that considers current stats, decision patterns, and moral imbalances without feeling repetitive?"

## PHASE 6: Visual Identity
---
Prompt 16: "Design a visual theme called 'Neon Morality' that balances futuristic aesthetics with ethical weight. Use neon colors (blue innovation, amber profit, emerald trust, violet ethics) against a deep space background."

Prompt 17: "Create a color system where each metric has a distinct emotional association: Innovation=Logic/Progress (blue), Profit=Ambition/Drive (amber), Trust=Empathy/Connection (emerald), Ethics=Conscience/Integrity (violet)."

## PHASE 7: Replayability Design
---
Prompt 18: "Design multiple viable strategies for winning: balanced approach (all stats 65-75%), specialist approach (one stat high, others maintained), and mixed approaches. Ensure no single dominant strategy."

Prompt 19: "Create a dynamic difficulty system that activates after round 6, applying gentle decay to high stats to prevent infinite growth while still allowing both balanced and specialist builds."

Prompt 20: "How can random events, AI-generated commentary, and multiple endings create a unique experience each playthrough despite limited scenario content?"
